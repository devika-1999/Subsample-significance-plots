# Subsample-significance-plots
Astrometric quality of Gaia DR3 QSOs plots
Plot 1. Standard deviation ratios of 840 subsamples (of Astrometric selection - Astrometrically well behaving sample of 1.9 million QSO candidates in Gaia DR3) relative to the main sample for parallax, proper motion in right ascension (PM RA), and proper motion in declination (PM Dec), plotted against subsample size on a logarithmic scale. Each point represents a subsample, colour-coded by whether it shows a significant deviation in standard deviation according to the Fligner-Killeen test at a threshold of p < 0.003. Significant subsamples are shown in red, while non-significant ones are shown in orange.
Plot 2. Skewness of the normalised astrometric parameters for 840 subsamples (of Astrometric selection - Astrometrically well behaving sample of 1.9 million QSO candidates in Gaia DR3) plotted against their sample size (log scale). Subsamples with significant skewness (based on the skewness test using standard deviation of skewness and three sigma threshold) are marked in red, while non-significant ones are shown in orange. The dashed blue line indicates the skewness of the full astrometric selection (main sample). Skewness values for a perfect normal distribution would be zero. The panels show results for parallax (left), proper motion in right ascension (middle), and proper motion in declination (right).
